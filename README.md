## Developer Portfolio

This is a second version of my portfolio that I had made in the past using just HTML and CSS. 

This is the link to the first version: [https://github.com/DevSamuelBrito/portfolio](https://github.com/DevSamuelBrito/portfolio) 

Now I'm looking to improve my skills and learn new technologies this project was done with `Next.js`



Download the project and in the terminal inside your folder, enter your command prompt and run the following commands:


```bash
# first use this:
npm install
# use one of the commands below
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
